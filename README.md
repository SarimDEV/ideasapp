# Ideas App

This app was made to help me get familiar with bringing together MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js, and then deploying. It's a simple note taking app that I'm using for jotting down my software project ideas. 

This app was deployed to Heroku, for a live version cick [here](https://lit-beach-96059.herokuapp.com/)
